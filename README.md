relilabs (aka reliverse labs) — an experimental all-in-one replacement for the entire js/ts ecosystem, dev environment, and more.

## Navigation

Each part of the system has its own README:

- [`reliverse's js alternative`](readme-js-alt.md) — a drop-in `.js` replacement with rust-like stability
- [`reliverse's npm alternative`](readme-npm-alt.md) — modern package registry and publishing flow
- [`reliverse's git alternative`](readme-git-alt.md) — a decentralized, developer-first approach to versioning

start from scratch or supercharge what you’ve got. `relilabs` is bun on steroids, with a chainsaw.
